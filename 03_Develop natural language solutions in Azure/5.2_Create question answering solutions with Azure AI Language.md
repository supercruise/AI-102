# [Create question answering solutions with Azure AI Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/)

The question answering capability of the Azure AI Language service makes it easy to build applications in which **users ask questions using natural language and receive appropriate answers**.

## Learning objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand question answering and how it compares to language understanding.
- Create, test, publish, and consume a knowledge base.
- Implement multi-turn conversation and active learning.
- Create a question answering bot to interact with using natural language.

## Introduction

A common pattern for "intelligent" applications is to enable users to ask questions using natural language, and receive appropriate answers. In effect, this kind of solution brings **conversational intelligence to a traditional frequently asked questions (FAQ) publication**. 

In this module, you will learn how to use Azure AI Language to **create a knowledge base of question and answer pairs** that can support an application or bot.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Understand question answering and how it compares to language understanding.
- Create, test, publish and consume a knowledge base.
- Implement multi-turn conversation and active learning.
- Create a question answering bot to interact with using natural language.

---

## Understand question answering

**Azure AI Language** includes a question answering capability, which enables you to define **a knowledge base of question and answer pairs** that can be queried using natural language input. The knowledge base can be published to a REST endpoint and consumed by client applications, commonly bots.

The knowledge base can be created from existing sources, including:

- Web sites containing frequently asked question (FAQ) documentation.
- Files containing structured text, such as brochures or user guides.
- Built-in chit chat question and answer pairs that encapsulate common conversational exchanges.

> Note: The question answering capability of Azure AI Language is a newer version of the QnA Service, which still exists as a standalone service. To learn how to migrate a QnA Maker knowledge base to Azure AI Language, see the [migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/question-answering/how-to/migrate-qnamaker).

## Compare question answering to Azure AI Language understanding

**A question answering knowledge base is a form of language model, which raises the question of when to use question answering**, and when to use the conversational language understanding capabilities of Azure AI Language.

The two features are similar in that they both enable you to define a language model that can be queried using natural language expressions. However, there are some differences in the use cases that they are designed to address, as shown in the following table:

| | Question answering | Language understanding |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Usage pattern	| User submits a question, expecting an answer	| User submits an utterance, expecting an appropriate response or action |
| Query processing | Service uses natural language understanding to match the question to an answer in the knowledge base | Service uses natural language understanding to interpret the utterance, match it to an intent, and identify entities |
| Response | Response is **a static answer to a known question** | Response indicates the most likely intent and referenced entities |
| Client logic | Client application typically presents the answer to the user | Client application is responsible for performing appropriate action based on the detected intent |

The two services are in fact complementary. You can build **comprehensive natural language solutions that combine language understanding models and question answering knowledge bases**.

## Create a knowledge base

To create a question answering solution, you can use the REST API or SDK to write code that defines, trains, and publishes the knowledge base. However, it's more common to use the [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com/) web interface to define and manage a knowledge base.

To create a knowledge base you:

1. Sign in to Azure portal.

2. Search for Azure AI services using the search field at the top of the portal.

3. Select Create under the Language Service resource.

4. Create a resource in your Azure subscription:
    - Enable the question answering feature.
    - Create or select an Azure AI Search resource to host the knowledge base index.

5. In Language Studio, select your Azure AI Language resource and create a Custom question answering project.

6. Add one or more data sources to populate the knowledge base:
    - URLs for web pages containing FAQs.
    - Files containing structured text from which questions and answers can be derived.
    - Predefined chit-chat datasets that include common conversational questions and responses in a specified style.

7. Edit question and answer pairs in the portal.

## Implement multi-turn conversation

Although you can often create an effective knowledge base that consists of individual question and answer pairs, sometimes you might need to **ask follow-up questions to elicit more information from a user before presenting a definitive answer**. This kind of interaction is referred to as a **multi-turn conversation**.

![Workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/media/multi-turn-conversation.png)

You can enable multi-turn responses when importing questions and answers from an existing web page or document based on its structure, or you can explicitly define follow-up prompts and responses for existing question and answer pairs.

For example, suppose an initial question for a travel booking knowledge base is "How can I cancel a reservation?". A reservation might refer to a hotel or a flight, so a follow-up prompt is required to clarify this detail. The answer might consist of text such as "Cancellation policies depend on the type of reservation" and include follow-up prompts with links to answers about canceling flights and canceling hotels.

**When you define a follow-up prompt for multi-turn conversation, you can link to an existing answer in the knowledge base or define a new answer specifically for the follow-up**. You can also restrict the linked answer so that it is only ever displayed in the context of the multi-turn conversation initiated by the original question.

---

## [Test and publish a knowledge base](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/6-test-publish-knowledge-base)

You can test your knowledge base interactively in Language Studio, submitting questions and reviewing the answers that are returned. You can inspect the results to view their confidence scores as well as other potential answers.

![language studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/media/test-new-small.png)

### Deploying a knowledge base

When you're happy with the performance of your knowledge base, you can deploy it to a REST endpoint that client applications can use to submit questions and receive answers. You can deploy it directly from **Language Studio**.

---

## Use a knowledge base

To consume the published knowledge base, you can use the REST interface.

The minimal request body for the function contains a question, like this:

`{
  "question": "What do I need to do to cancel a reservation?",
  "top": 2,
  "scoreThreshold": 20,
  "strictFilters": [
    {
      "name": "category",
      "value": "api"
    }
  ]
}`

| Property | Description |
| -- | -- |
| question | Question to send to the knowledge base. |
| top | Maximum number of answers to be returned. |
| scoreThreshold | _Score threshold for answers returned_. |
| strictFilters | Limit to only answers that contain the specified metadata. |

The response includes the closest question match that was found in the knowledge base, along with the associated answer, the confidence score, and other metadata about the question and answer pair:

## Improve question answering performance

After creating and testing a knowledge base, you can **improve its performance with active learning and by defining synonyms**.

### Use active learning

Active learning can help you make continuous improvements to get better at answering user questions correctly over time. People often ask questions that are phrased differently, but ultimately have the same meaning. Active learning can help in situations like this because it enables you to consider alternate questions to each question and answer pair. Active learning is enabled by default.

To use active learning, you can do the following:

#### Create your question and answer pairs

You create pairs of questions and answers in Language Studio for your project. You can also import a file that contains question and answer pairs to upload in bulk.

![Create Q and A pairs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/media/import-file.png#lightbox)

#### Review suggestions

Active learning then begins to offer alternate questions for each question in your question and answer pairs. You access this from the Review suggestions pane:

![Suggestion pane](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/media/review-suggestions.png#lightbox)

You review, and then accept or reject these alternate phrases suggested for each question by selecting the checkmark or delete symbol next to the alternate phrase. You can bulk accept or reject suggestions using the Accept all suggestions or Reject all suggestions option at the top.

You can also manually add alternate questions when you select Add alternate question for a pair in the Edit knowledge base pane:

![Edit knowledge base](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/media/add-alternate-questions-manual.png#lightbox)

> Note: To learn more about active learning, see [Enrich your project with active learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/question-answering/tutorials/active-learning).

### Define synonyms

Synonyms are useful when questions submitted by users might **include multiple different words to mean the same thing**. For example, a travel agency customer might refer to a "reservation" or a "booking". By defining these as synonyms, the question answering service can find an appropriate answer regardless of which term an individual customer uses.

To define synonyms, you use the REST API to submit synonyms in the following JSON format:

`{
    "synonyms": [
        {
            "alterations": [
                "reservation",
                "booking"
                ]
        }
    ]
}`

> Note: To learn more about synonyms, see the [Improve quality of response with synonyms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/question-answering/tutorials/adding-synonyms).

## [Exercise - Create a question answering solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-question-answer-solution-ai-language/10-exercise-create)

### [Create a Question Answering Solution](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-language/Instructions/Exercises/02-qna.html)

One of the most common conversational scenarios is providing support through a knowledge base of frequently asked questions (FAQs). Many organizations publish FAQs as documents or web pages, which works well for a small set of question and answer pairs, but large documents can be difficult and time-consuming to search.

**Azure AI Language** includes a question answering capability that enables you to create a knowledge base of question and answer pairs that can be queried using natural language input, and is most commonly used as a resource that a bot can use to look up answers to questions submitted by users.
