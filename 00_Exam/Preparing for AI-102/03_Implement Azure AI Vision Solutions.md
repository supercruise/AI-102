## Select visual features to meet image processing requirements

The Azure AI Vision Image Analysis service can be used to extract several features from images.

- Retrieve image descriptions and tags
- Model customization
- Read text from image (OCR)
- Detect objects and people
- Generate image captions
- Identify and tag visual features in an image
- Smart crop
- Background removal
