# [Create a custom skill for Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-ai-custom-skill/)

Use the power of artificial intelligence to **enrich your data and find new insights with custom skills** in Azure AI Search.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll learn how to:

- Implement a custom skill for Azure AI Search
- Create a **custom text classification skill**
- Create a **machine learning custom skill**

---

## Introduction

You can use the predefined skills in Azure AI Search to greatly **enrich an index by extracting additional information from the source data**. However, there may be occasions when you have specific data extraction needs that can't be met with the predefined skills and require some custom functionality.

For example:

- Integrate the Document Intelligence service to extract data from forms.
- Consume an Azure Machine Learning model to integrate predicted values into an index.
- Any other custom logic.

To support these scenarios, you can implement custom skills as web-hosted services (such as Azure Functions) that support the required interface for integration into a skillset.

In this module you'll learn how to:

- Implement a custom skill for Azure AI Search
- Integrate a custom skill into an Azure AI Search skillset
- Enrich a search index using a **custom text classification model**
- Enrich a search index with an **Azure Machine Learning custom skill**

> Note: This module assumes you already know how to create and use an Azure AI Search solution that includes built-in skills. If not, complete the [Create an Azure AI Search solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-cognitive-search-solution/) module first.
