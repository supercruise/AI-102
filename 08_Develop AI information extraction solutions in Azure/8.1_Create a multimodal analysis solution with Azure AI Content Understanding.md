## Introduction

Organizations today rely on information that is often locked up in content assets such as documents, images, videos, and audio recordings. Extracting information from this content can be challenging, laborious, and time-consuming, and organizations often need to build solutions based on multiple technologies for content analysis depending on the formats being used.

**Azure AI Content Understanding** is **a multimodal service that simplifies the creation of AI-powered analyzers that can extract information from content** in practically any format.

## What is Azure AI Content Understanding?

**Azure AI Content Understanding** is *a generative AI service that you can use to extract insights and data from multiple kinds of content*. With Content Understanding, you can quickly build applications that analyze complex data and generate outputs that can be used to automate and optimize processes.

**Content Understanding** is a component of Azure AI services. To use it, you need to provision an Azure AI services resource in your Azure subscription. You can develop and manage a Content Understanding solution:

- In the Azure AI Foundry portal
- By using the Content Understanding REST API

### Multimodal content analysis

Content Understanding can extract information from common kinds of content, enabling you to use a single service with a straightforward and consistent development process to **build multimodal content analysis solutions**.

#### Documents and forms

You can use Content Understanding to **analyze documents and forms and retrieve specific field values**. For example, you could extract key data values from an invoice to automate payment processing.

#### Images

You can analyze images to *infer information from visuals such as charts, identify physical defects in products or other items, detect the presence of specific objects or people, or determine other information visually*.

#### Audio

Analysis of audio enables you to automate tasks like *summarizing conference calls, determining sentiment of recorded customer conversations, or extracting key data from telephone messages*.

#### Video

Video accounts for a large volume of the data captured today, and you can use Content Understanding to analyze and extract insights from video to support many scenarios. For example, to extract key points from video conference recordings, to summarize presentations, or to detect the presence of specific activity in security footage.

## [Create a Content Understanding analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-content-ai/03-create-analyzer)

**Content Understanding** solutions are based on the creation of an analyzer; which is trained to extract specific information from a particular type of content based on a schema that you define.

The high-level process for creating a Content Understanding solution includes the following steps:

![steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/analyze-content-ai/media/analyzer.png)

1. Create an *Azure AI services resource*.
2. **Define a Content Understanding schema** for the information to be extracted. This can be based on **a content sample** and **an analyzer template**.
3. **Build an analyzer** based on the completed schema.
4. Use the analyzer to extract or generate fields from new content.

Numerous analyzer templates are provided to help you develop an appropriate analyzer for your needs quickly. Additionally, because of the generative AI capabilities of Content Understanding, you can use minimal training data to define a schema by example. In many cases, the service accurately identifies the data values in the sample content that map to the schema elements automatically, though you can also explicitly label fields in content such as documents to improve the performance of your analyzer.
