## Introduction

**AI agents are transforming how applications interact with users and automate tasks**. Unlike traditional programs, AI agents use generative AI to interpret data, make decisions, and complete tasks with minimal human intervention. These agents use large language models to streamline complex workflows, making them ideal for automating business processes.

Developers can build AI agents using different tools, including the **Semantic Kernel SDK**. This open-source SDK simplifies the integration of AI models into applications. The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework supports different types of agents, including `ChatCompletionAgent`, `OpenAIAssistantAgent`, and `AzureAIAgent`. This module focuses on the `AzureAIAgent`, a type of agent that streamlines the features and functionalities of **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**.

**Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a fully managed service that enables developers to securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality extensible AI agents**. Using the Foundry Agent Service, developers don't need to manage the underlying compute or storage resources. Using the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework allows developers to quickly build agents on the Foundry Agent Service, with support for natural language processing and access to built-in tools in just a few lines of code.

While Foundry Agent Service provides a powerful foundation for building AI agents, Semantic Kernel offers additional flexibility and scalability. If you've already started developing agents with Semantic Kernel, you can seamlessly integrate Azure AI Agent capabilities, such as built-in tools and project deployment, without rewriting your code. Also, if your solution requires multiple types of agents, using Semantic Kernel ensures consistency across your implementation. Finally, if you're planning to develop multi-agent solutions, **Semantic Kernel's GroupChat feature** allows you to orchestrate collaborative agents efficiently—a topic covered in more detail in a later module.

Suppose you need to develop an AI agent that automatically formats and emails expense reports for employees. Your AI agent can extract data from submitted expense reports, format them correctly, and send them to the appropriate recipients. To do this, you can use the **Semantic Kernel Agent Framework**. The plugins and functions feature allows your AI agent to interact with APIs, retrieve necessary data, and complete tasks.

In this module, you learn about the core features of the **Semantic Kernel SDK and the Agent Framework**. You also learn how to create your own AI agents and extend their capabilities with plugin functions.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Use Semantic Kernel to connect to an Azure AI Foundry project.
- Create Foundry Agent Service agents using the Semantic Kernel SDK.
- Integrate plugin functions with your AI agent.

## Understand Semantic Kernel AI agents

**An AI agent is a program that uses generative AI to interpret data, make decisions, and perform tasks on behalf of users or other applications**. AI agents rely on large language models to perform their tasks. Unlike conventional programs, AI agents can function autonomously, handling complex workflows and automating processes without requiring continuous human oversight.

AI Agents can be developed using many different tools and platforms, including the **Semantic Kernel SDK**. Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that enables developers to easily integrate the latest AI models into their applications. Part of that SDK includes the **Semantic Kernel Agent Framework**, which allows developers to quickly create functional agents that can use natural language processing to complete tasks.

### Semantic Kernel core components

The Semantic Kernel offers different components that can be used individually or combined.

- **AI service connectors** - connect the code to AI services from different providers under a common interface. Supported services include *Chat Completion, Text Generation, and more*.
- **Memory connectors** - expose *vector stores* from other providers under a common interface.
- **Functions and plugins** - containers for functions that are registered with the kernel. Once registered, functions can be invoked by the AI or through prompt templates.
- **Prompt templates** - combine instructions, user input, and function outputs into a reusable format. Prompt templates allow AI models to execute predefined steps dynamically.
- **Filters** - allow custom actions to be performed before and after a function or prompt is invoked. When registered, **function filters** act as outer layers and **prompt filters** as inner layers.

### Agent framework components

The Agent Framework within Semantic Kernel helps streamline the creation of agents and enables multi-agent collaboration in conversations while integrating human input. The framework supports different types of agents, including `ChatCompletionAgent`, `OpenAIAssistantAgent`, and `AzureAIAgent`.

### What is an Azure AI Agent?

The `AzureAIAgent` class provides a seamless way to build and interact with AI agents using the **Foundry Agent Service**. It abstracts the complexity of managing AI agents by offering a more structured and intuitive interface within the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework. Key benefits include:

- **Simplified agent creation** – The `AzureAIAgent` class allows developers to define AI agents with minimal configuration, leveraging the power of Foundry Agent Service without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Automatic tool invocation** – The agent can automatically call and execute tools, integrating seamlessly with Azure AI Search, Bing, Azure Functions, and more.
- **Thread and conversation management** – Provides built-in mechanisms for managing conversation *states*, ensuring smooth multi-agent interactions.
- **Secure enterprise integration** – Enables secure and compliant AI agent development with keyless authentication and customizable storage options.

By using the `AzureAIAgent` class, developers can take full advantage of Foundry Agent Service while taking advantage of the features offered by the Semantic Kernel SDK. This allows for robust AI-driven workflows that scale efficiently across enterprise applications.

### Agent framework core concepts

- **Agent** - abstraction for AI agents, with specialized subclasses like `AzureAIAgent`, allowing for task completion and human interaction in conversations.

- **Agent threads** - manage conversation *state* and stores conversations.

- **Agent chat** - the foundation for **multi-agent interactions**, allows for structured conversations and collaboration.

- **Agent channel** - used for custom agent development, allows different types of agents to participate in AgentChat.

- **Agent messages** - a unified structure for agent communication, provides seamless communication and integration with existing AI workflows.

- **Templating** - like **Semantic Kernel prompt templates**, templates use dynamic prompt configurations to shape agent behavior.

- **Functions and plugins** - like **Semantic Kernel plugins**, agent plugin functions allow developers to extend agent capabilities by incorporating custom functions.

This framework supports autonomous, multi-agent AI behaviors while maintaining consistency with Semantic Kernel's design, allowing developers to build intelligent, adaptable AI systems.

## Create an Azure AI agent with Semantic Kernel

`AzureAIAgent` *is a specialized agent within the Semantic Kernel framework*, designed to provide advanced conversational capabilities with seamless tool integration. It automates tool calling, eliminating the need for manual parsing and invocation. The agent also securely manages conversation history using threads, reducing the overhead of maintaining state. The AzureAIAgent class supports many built-in tools, including *file retrieval, code execution, and data interaction via Bing, Azure AI Search, Azure Functions, and OpenAPI*.

### Creating an AzureAIAgent

An `AzureAIAgent` object encapsulates all the core capabilities you typically use the Kernel for, like function execution, planning, and memory access. This object acts as a self-contained agent runtime.

To use an AzureAIAgent:

1. Create an Azure AI Foundry project.
2. Add the project connection string to your Semantic Kernel application code.
3. Create an `AzureAIAgentSettings` object.
4. Create an `AzureAIAgent` client.
5. Create an agent definition on the agent service provided by the client.
6. Create an agent based on the definition.

Here's the code that illustrates how to create an `AzureAIAgent`:

Once your agent is defined, you can create a thread to interact with your agent and invoke responses for inputs. For example:

### AzureAIAgent key components

The Semantic Kernel `AzureAIAgent` object relies on the following components to function:

- `AzureAISAgentSettings` - an object that automatically includes the Azure AI Agent settings from the environment configuration. These settings will be used by the `AzureAIAgents` you create.

- `AzureAIAgent` client - an object that manages the connection to your Azure AI Foundry project. This object allows you to access the services and models associated with your project.

- Agent service - the `AzureAIAgent` client also contains an agent operations service. This service helps streamline the process of creating, managing, and running the agents for your project.

- Agent definition - the AzureAI Agent model created via the AzureAI Project client. This definition specifies the AI deployment model that should be used, and the name and instructions for the agent.

- `AzureAIAgentThread` - automatically maintains the **conversation history** between agents and users, and the state. You can add messages to a thread and use the agent to invoke a response from the LLM.

These components work together to allow you to create an agent with instructions to define its purpose and invoke responses from the AI model.

## [Add plugins to Azure AI agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-ai-agent-with-semantic-kernel/4-add-plugins-to-agent)

**In Semantic Kernel, plugins allow your AI agent to use existing APIs to perform tasks it couldn't do on its own**. Plugins work through function calling, allowing AI to request and use specific functions. Semantic Kernel routes the request to the appropriate function in your codebase and returns the results back to the LLM so the LLM can generate a final response.

To enable automatic orchestration with function calling, plugins also need to provide details that describe **how they behave**. The function's **input, output, and side effects** should be described in a way that the AI can understand, otherwise, the AI will not correctly call the function.

### How to use plugins with AzureAIAgent

1. Define your plugin: You can create a plugin by defining a class and annotating its methods with the `kernel_function` decorator. The decorator lets Semantic Kernel know that this function can be called by the AI or referenced in a prompt. The `kernel_function` decorator also supports a `description` attribute to help the AI understand how to use the function.
2. Add the plugin to your agent: Once you define your plugin, you can add it to your AzureAIAgent by creating a new instance of the plugin and adding it to the agent's plugin collection.
3. Invoke the plugin's functions: You can invoke your plugin's functions by using prompts on your agent's message thread. For example, if you have a plugin function called `get_tasks`, your prompt to the agent might be "What tasks do I have?".

By following these steps, you can extend your `AzureAIAgent` with plugins, allowing it to interact with APIs and perform more advanced tasks. This makes your AI more powerful and capable of handling real-world applications efficiently.
