## Introduction
Azure AI Foundry Agent Service offers a seamless way to build an agent without needing extensive AI or machine learning expertise. By using tools, you can provide your agent with functionality to execute actions on your behalf.

The AI Agent Service provides built-in tools for gathering knowledge and generating code, which provide your agent with some powerful functionality. However, sometimes your agent needs to be able to complete specific tasks or actions that an AI model would struggle to handle on its own. To accomplish these actions, you can **provide your agent a custom tool based on your own code or a third-party service or API**.

Imagine you're working in the retail industry, and your company is struggling with managing customer inquiries efficiently. The customer support team is overwhelmed with repetitive questions, leading to delays in response times and decreased customer satisfaction. By using Foundry Agent Service with custom tools, you can **create a custom FAQ agent that handles common inquiries**. This agent can be provided with a set of custom tools to look up customer orders, freeing up your support team to focus on more complex issues.

In this module, you'll learn how to utilize custom tools in Foundry Agent Service to enhance productivity, improve accuracy, and create tailored solutions for specific needs.

### Why use custom tools?

Custom tools in Azure AI services can significantly enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows that are specific to your use case. These tools improve accuracy by providing precise and consistent outputs, reducing the likelihood of human error. Additionally, custom tools offer tailored solutions that address specific business needs, enabling organizations to optimize their processes and achieve better outcomes.

- **Enhanced productivity**: Automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows.
- **Improved accuracy**: Provide precise and consistent outputs, reducing human error.
- **Tailored solutions**: Address specific business needs and optimize processes.

Adding tools makes custom functionality available for the agent to use, depending on how it decides to respond to the user prompt. For example, consider how **a custom tool to retrieve weather data from an external meteorological service** could be used by an agent.

The diagram shows the process of an agent choosing to use the custom tool:

1. A user asks an agent about the weather conditions in a ski resort.
2. The agent determines that it has access to a tool that can use an API to get meteorological information, and calls it.
3. The tool returns the weather report, and the agent informs the user.

## Options for implementing custom tools

Azure AI Foundry Agent Service offers various custom tools that enhance the capabilities and efficiency of your AI agents. These tools allow for scalable interoperability with various applications, making it easier to integrate with existing infrastructure or web services.

### Custom tool options available in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

Azure AI services provide several custom tool options, including **OpenAPI specified tools, Azure Functions, and function calling**. These tools enable seamless integration with external APIs, event-driven applications, and custom functions.

- **Custom function**: Function calling allows you to *describe the structure of custom functions to an agent and return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments*. The agent can dynamically identify appropriate functions based on their definitions. This feature is useful for integrating custom logic and workflows, in a selection of programming languages, into your AI agents.
- **Azure Functions**: Azure Functions enable you to create intelligent, event-driven applications with minimal overhead. They support **triggers and bindings**, which simplify how your AI Agents interact with external systems and services. *Triggers determine when a function executes, while bindings facilitate streamlined connections to input or output data sources*.
- **OpenAPI specification tools**: These tools allow you to connect your Azure AI Agent to an external API using an **OpenAPI 3.0 specification**. This provides standardized, automated, and scalable API integrations that enhance the capabilities of your agent. OpenAPI specifications describe HTTP APIs, enabling people to understand how an API works, generate client code, create tests, and apply design standards.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: This action provides **low-code/no-code solutions** to add workflows and connects apps, data, and services with the low-code Logic App.

This flexibility to integrate custom functionality in multiple ways enables a wide range of extensibility possibilities for your Foundry Agent Service agents.

## How to integrate custom tools

**Custom tools in an agent can be defined in a handful of ways**, depending on what works best for your scenario. You may find that your company already has Azure Functions implemented for your agent to use, or a public OpenAPI specification gives your agent the functionality you're looking for.

### Function Calling

Function calling allows agents to execute predefined functions dynamically based on user input. This feature is ideal for scenarios where agents need to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving data or processing user queries, and can be done in code from within the agent. Your function may call out to other APIs to get additional information or initiate a program.

#### Example: Defining and using a function

Start by defining a function that the agent can call. For instance, here's a fake snowfall tracking function:

Register the function with your agent using the Azure AI SDK:

The agent can now call recent_snowfall dynamically when it determines that the prompt requires information that can be retrieved by the function.

### Azure Functions

Azure Functions provide serverless computing capabilities for real-time processing. This integration is ideal for event-driven workflows, enabling agents to respond to triggers such as HTTP requests or queue messages.

#### Example: Using Azure Functions with a queue trigger

First, develop and deploy your Azure Function. In this example, imagine we have a function in our Azure subscription to fetch the snowfall for a given location.

When your Azure Function is in place, integrate add it to the agent definition as an Azure Function tool:

The agent can now send requests to the Azure Function via a storage queue and process the results.

### OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI defined tools allow agents to interact with external APIs using standardized specifications. This approach simplifies API integration and ensures compatibility with various services. The Foundry Agent Service uses **OpenAPI 3.0** specified tools.

> Tip: Currently, three authentication types are supported with OpenAPI 3.0 tools: anonymous, API key, and managed identity.

#### Example: Using an OpenAPI specification

First, create a JSON file (in this example, called snowfall_openapi.json) describing the API.

Then, register the OpenAPI tool in the agent defintion:

The agent can now use the OpenAPI tool to fetch snowfall data dynamically.

> Note: One of the concepts related to agents and custom tools that developers often have difficulty with is the declarative nature of the solution. You don't need to write code that explicitly calls your custom tool functions - the agent itself decides to call tool functions based on messages in prompts. By providing the agent with functions that have meaningful names and well-documented parameters, the agent can "figure out" when and how to call the function all by itself!

By using one of the available custom tool options (or any combination of them), you can create powerful, flexible, and intelligent agents with Foundry Agent Service. These integrations enable seamless interaction with external systems, real-time processing, and scalable workflows, making it easier to build custom solutions tailored to your needs.
