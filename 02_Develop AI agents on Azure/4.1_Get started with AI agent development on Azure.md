## Introduction

As generative AI models become more powerful and ubiquitous, their use has grown beyond simple "chat" applications to power intelligent agents that can operate autonomously to automate tasks. Increasingly, organizations are **using generative AI models to build agents** that orchestrate business processes and coordinate workloads in ways that were previously unimaginable.

This module discusses some of the core concepts related to AI agents, and introduces some of the technologies that developers can use to build agentic solutions on Microsoft Azure.

## What are AI agents?

**AI agents** are **smart software services that combine generative AI models with contextual data and the ability to automate tasks based on user input and environmental factors that they perceive.**

For example, an organization might build an AI agent to help employees manage expense claims. The agent might use a generative model combined with corporate expenses policy documentation to answer employee questions about what expenses can be claimed and what limits apply. Additionally, the agent could use a programmatic function to automatically submit expense claims for regularly repeated expenses (such as a monthly cellphone bill) or intelligently route expenses to the appropriate approver based on claim amounts.

An example of the expenses agent scenario is shown in the following diagram.

![Scenario](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-agent-fundamentals/media/expenses-agent.png)

The diagram shows the following process:

1. A user asks the expense agent a question about expenses that can be claimed.
2. The expenses agent accepts the question as a prompt.
3. The agent uses a knowledge store containing expenses policy information to ground the prompt.
4. The grounded prompt is submitted to the agent's language model to generate a response.
5. The agent generates an expense claim on behalf of the user and submits it to be processed and generate a check payment.

In more complex scenarios, organizations can develop multi-agent solutions in which multiple agents coordinate work between them. For example, *a travel booking agent could book flights and hotels for employees* and *automatically submit expense claims with appropriate receipts to the expenses agent*, as shown in this diagram:

![Workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/ai-agent-fundamentals/media/multi-agent.png)

The diagram shows the following process:

1. A user provides details of an upcoming trip to a travel booking agent.
2. The travel booking agent automates the booking of flight tickets and hotel reservations.
3. The travel booking agent initiates an expense claim for the travel costs through the expense agent.
4. The expense agent submits the expense claim for processing.

## [Options for agent development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/ai-agent-fundamentals/3-agent-development)

There are many ways that developers can create AI agents, including multiple frameworks and SDKs.

### [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/)

Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a managed service in Azure that is designed to provide a framework for **creating, managing, and using AI agents within Azure AI Foundry**. The service is based on the OpenAI Assistants API but with increased choice of models, data integration, and enterprise security; enabling you to use both the OpenAI SDK and the Azure Foundry SDK to develop agentic solutions.

### [OpenAI Assistants API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/assistant)

**The OpenAI Assistants API provides a subset of the features in Foundry Agent Service**, and can **only be used with OpenAI models**. In Azure, you can use the Assistants API with Azure OpenAI, though in practice the Foundry Agent Service provides greater flexibility and functionality for agent development on Azure.

### [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/)

Semantic Kernel is a **lightweight, open-source development kit** that you can use to build AI agents and orchestrate multi-agent solutions. The core Semantic Kernel SDK is designed for all kinds of generative AI development, while the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework is a platform specifically optimized for creating agents and implementing agentic solution patterns.

### [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html)

AutoGen is an open-source framework for developing agents rapidly. It's **useful as a research and ideation tool** when experimenting with agents.

### [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/)

Developers can create self-hosted agents for delivery through a wide range of channels by using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK. Despite the name, agents built using this SDK are not limited to Microsoft 365, but can be delivered through channels like Slack or Messenger.

### [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/)

Microsoft Copilot Studio provides a **low-code development environment** that "citizen developers" can use to quickly build and deploy agents that integrate with a Microsoft 365 ecosystem or commonly used channels like Slack and Messenger. The visual design interface of Copilot Studio makes it a good choice for building agents when you have little or no professional software development experience.

### [Copilot Studio agent builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-agent-builder-build)

Business users can use the declarative Copilot Studio agent builder tool in Microsoft 365 Copilot to author basic agents for common tasks. The declarative nature of the tool enables users to create an agent by describing the functionality they need, or they can use an intuitive visual interface to specify options for their agent.

### Choosing an agent development solution

With such a wide range of available tools and frameworks, it can be challenging to decide which ones to use. Use the following **considerations** to help you identify the right choices for your scenario:

- For business users with little or no software development experience, **Copilot Studio agent builder in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** provides a way to create simple declarative agents that automate everyday tasks. This approach can empower users across an organization to benefit from AI agents with minimal impact on IT.
- If business users have sufficient technical skills to build low-code solutions using Microsoft Power Platform technologies, Copilot Studio enables them to combine those skills with their business domain knowledge and build agent solutions that extend the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Copilot or add agentic functionality to common channels like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Messenger.
- When an organization needs more complex extensions to Microsoft 365 Copilot capabilities, professional developers can use the **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK** to build agents that target the same channels as Copilot Studio.
- To develop agentic solutions that use Azure back-end services with a wide choice of models, custom storage and search services, and integration with Azure AI services, professional developers should use Foundry Agent Service.
- Start with **Foundry Agent Service to develop single, standalone agents**. When you need to build multi-agent solutions, use Semantic Kernel to orchestrate the agents in your solution.

## Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a service within Azure that you can use to create, test, and manage AI agents. It provides both a visual agent development experience in the Azure AI Foundry portal and **a code-first development experience using the Azure AI Foundry SDK**.

### Components of an agent

Agents developed using Foundry Agent Service have the following elements:

- **Model**: A deployed generative AI model that enables the agent to reason and generate natural language responses to prompts. You can use common OpenAI models and a selection of models from the Azure AI Foundry model catalog.
- **Knowledge**: data sources that enable the agent to ground prompts with contextual data. Potential knowledge sources include Internet search results from Microsoft Bing, an Azure AI Search index, or your own data and documents.
- **Tools**: Programmatic functions that enable the agent to automate actions. Built-in tools to access knowledge in Azure AI Search and Bing are provided as well as a code interpreter tool that you can use to generate and run Python code. You can also create custom tools using your own code or Azure Functions.

Conversations between users and agents take place on a thread, which retains a history of the messages exchanged in the conversation as well as any data assets, such as files, that are generated.
