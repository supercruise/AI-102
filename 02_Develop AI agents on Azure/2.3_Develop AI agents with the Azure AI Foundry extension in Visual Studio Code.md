System instructions - Define the agent's behavior, personality, and response style
- **Agent ID** - Automatically generated by the extension

#### Understanding the agent YAML file

Your AI agent is defined in a YAML file that contains all configuration details. Here's an example structure:

~~~yaml
yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/ai-foundry-vsc/agent/1.0.0
version: 1.0.0
name: my-agent
description: Description of the agent
id: ''
metadata:
  authors:
    - author1
    - author2
  tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
model:
  id: 'gpt-4o-1'
  options:
    temperature: 1
    top_p: 1
instructions: Instructions for the agent
tools: []
~~~

This YAML file is opened automatically alongside the Designer view, allowing you to work with either the visual interface or edit the configuration directly.

### Agent instruction design

Well-crafted instructions are the foundation of effective AI agents. They define how your agent understands its role, responds to users, and handles various scenarios.

#### Best practices for instructions

When writing system instructions for your agent:

- **Be specific and clear** - Define exactly what the agent should do and how it should behave
- **Provide context** - Explain the agent's role and the environment it operates in
- **Set boundaries** - Clearly define what the agent should and shouldn't do
- **Include examples** - Show the agent examples of desired interactions when helpful
- **Define personality** - Establish the tone and style of responses

#### Instruction examples

For a customer service agent, effective instructions might include:

- The agent's role and purpose
- Guidelines for handling different types of customer inquiries
- Escalation procedures for complex issues
- Tone and communication style preferences

### Deploying agents

Once you configure your agent, you can deploy it to Azure AI Foundry.

#### Deployment process

To deploy your agent:

- **Select the "Create on Azure AI Foundry" button** in the bottom-left of the Designer
- **Wait for deployment completion** - The extension handles the deployment process

#### Using the playground

After configuring your agent, you can test it using the built-in playground:

- **Real-time conversations** - Chat with your agent to test responses
- **Instruction validation** - Verify the agent follows its configured instructions
- **Behavior testing** - Test how the agent handles different types of requests
- **Iterative refinement** - Make adjustments based on testing results

### Working with agent threads

When you interact with deployed agents, **the system creates threads to manage conversation sessions**:

- **Threads** - Conversation sessions between an agent and user that store messages and handle context management
- **Messages** - Individual interactions that can include text, images, and files
- **Runs** - Single executions of an agent that use the agent's configuration and thread messages

You can view and manage these threads through the Azure Resources view in the extension.

Creating and configuring AI agents with the Azure AI Foundry Visual Studio Code extension provides a powerful yet accessible approach to agent development. The extension provides visual design tools, direct YAML editing, comprehensive configuration options, and integrated testing capabilities.

## Extend AI agent capabilities with tools

One of the most powerful features of AI agents is their ability to use tools that extend their capabilities beyond simple text generation. The Azure AI Foundry for Visual Studio Code extension makes it easy to add and configure tools for your agents. These tools enable agents to perform actions, access data, and integrate with external systems.

### Understanding agent tools

**Tools are programmatic functions that enable agents to automate actions and access information beyond their training data**. When an agent determines that a tool is needed to respond to a user request, it can automatically invoke the appropriate tool, process the results, and incorporate them into its response. This capability transforms agents from simple text generators into powerful automation systems that can interact with real-world data and services.

### Built-in tools

Azure AI Foundry provides several built-in tools that you can easily add to your agents without any additional configuration or setup. These tools are production-ready and handle common use cases that many agents require.

- **Code Interpreter** - Enables agents to **write and execute Python code for mathematical calculations, data analysis, chart generation, file processing, and complex problem-solving**
- **File Search** - Provides retrieval-augmented generation by uploading and indexing documents, searching knowledge bases, and supporting various file formats (PDF, Word, text files)
- **Grounding with Bing Search** - Allows agents to search the internet for real-time data, current events, and trending topics while providing citations and sources
- **OpenAPI Specified Tools** - Connects agents to external APIs and services through OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Standardized tool interfaces for extended functionality and community-driven tools

### Adding tools in Visual Studio Code

The Azure AI Foundry extension provides an intuitive interface for adding tools to your agents through a streamlined process. The visual interface makes it easy to browse, configure, and test tools without writing any code:

- Select your agent in the extension
- Navigate to the Tools section in the configuration panel
- Browse available tools from the tool library
- Configure tool settings as needed
- Test tool integration using the playground

When you add a tool, you can also add any new assets it needs. For example, if you add a File Search tool, you can use an existing vector store asset or make a new asset for your vector store to host your uploaded files.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

MCP servers provide a standardized way to add tools to your agents using an open protocol. This approach enables you to use community-built tools and create reusable components that work across different agent implementations.

Key benefits include:

- **Standardized protocol** for consistent tool communication
- **Reusable components** that work across different agents
- **Community-driven tools** available through MCP registries
- **Simplified integration** with consistent interfaces

The extension supports adding MCP servers through registry browsing, custom server addition, configuration management, and testing and validation.

### Tool management and best practices

Effective tool management ensures your agents perform reliably and efficiently in production environments. Following best practices helps you avoid common pitfalls and optimize agent performance:

#### Tool Selection Guidelines

- Identify what capabilities your agent requires
- Start with built-in tools before adding custom solutions
- Test thoroughly to validate tool behavior in various scenarios
- Monitor performance to track tool usage and effectiveness

Adding tools and extending agent capabilities through the Azure AI Foundry Visual Studio Code extension enables you to create sophisticated AI agents that can handle complex real-world tasks.
