## Introduction

AI agents offer a powerful combination of technologies, able to complete tasks with the use of generative AI. However, in some situations, the task required might be larger than is realistic for a single agent. For those scenarios, consider a multi-agent solution. A multi-agent solution allows agents to collaborate within the same conversation.

Imagine you're trying to address common DevOps challenges such as monitoring application performance, identifying issues, and deploying fixes. A multi-agent system could consist of four specialized agents working collaboratively:

- The Monitoring Agent continuously ingests logs and metrics, detects anomalies using natural language processing (NLP), and triggers alerts when issues arise.

- The Root Cause Analysis Agent then correlates these anomalies with recent system changes, using machine learning models or predefined rules to pinpoint the root cause of the problem.

Once the root cause is identified, the Automated Deployment Agent takes over to implement fixes or roll back problematic changes by interacting with CI/CD pipelines and executing deployment scripts.

Finally, the Reporting Agent generates detailed reports summarizing the anomalies, root causes, and resolutions, and notifies stakeholders via email or other communication channels.

This modular, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent system streamlines the DevOps process. The agents collaborate to reduce manual intervention and improve efficiency while ensuring timely communication and resolution of issues.

In this module, you'll explore how to use the powerful capabilities of the Microsoft Agent Framework to design and orchestrate intelligent agents that work collaboratively to solve complex problems. You'll also learn about the different types of orchestration patterns available, and use the Microsoft Agent Framework to develop your own AI agents that can collaborate for a multi-agent solution.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

Build AI agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK

## Understand the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework

Semantic Kernel is an **open-source SDK that enables developers to integrate AI models into their applications**. Part of that SDK is the Semantic Kernel Agents Framework, enabling the creation of agents using the same features that exist in the core Semantic Kernel framework.

### What is the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework?

**The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework is a framework designed to help developers build AI-powered agents**. These agents can process user inputs, make decisions, and execute tasks autonomously by leveraging large language models and traditional programming logic. The framework provides structured components for defining AI-driven workflows, enabling agents to interact with users, APIs, and external services.

### Core concepts

The Agent Framework in Semantic Kernel provides architecture on top of existing Semantic Kernel resources, including:

- Agents: **Agents are intelligent, AI-driven entities capable of reasoning and executing tasks**. They use language models, functions, and memory to make decisions dynamically.
- Agent collaboration: **Agents can collaborate together through an agent group chat**, which enables multiple agents to join the same chat, even of different agent types. Agent group chats determine which agent should respond and how to determine if the conversation is finished.

The features that power Semantic Kernel are also still available within the Agent Framework, including:

- Kernel: **The kernel is the central component of the Semantic Kernel**. The kernel acts as the execution engine, managing AI interactions, function orchestration, and memory.
- Tools and plugins: Plugins align with existing Semantic Kernel features, enabling agents to dynamically interact with external services or execute complex tasks through function calling. Within the Agent Framework, tools are available to provide extra functionality to your agents, such as file searching or code interpreter, similar to tool usage in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. Agents use tools and plugins to perform specific tasks.
- History: **Agents can maintain chat history across multiple interactions, allowing them to track previous interactions and adapt responses accordingly**. The conversation history is always accessible by the agents, either as a whole or for a specific agent's chat history.

### Types of agents

The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework supports several different types of agents, including:

- **Azure AI Agent** - a specialized agent within the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework. The AzureAIAgent type is designed to **provide advanced conversational capabilities with seamless tool integration**. It automates tool calling and securely manages conversation history using threads, reducing the overhead of maintaining state. The AzureAIAgent also supports a variety of built-in tools, including file retrieval, code execution, and data interaction via Bing, Azure AI Search, Azure Functions, and OpenAPI.

- **Chat Completion Agent**: designed for **chat completion and conversation interfaces**. The ChatCompletionAgent type mirrors the features and patterns in the underlying AI Service to support natural language processing, contextual understanding, and dialogue management.

- **OpenAI Assistant Agent**: designed for more advanced capabilities and multi-step tasks. The OpenAIAssistantAgent type supports goal-driven interactions with additional features like code interpretation and file search.

### Why you should use the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework

**The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework offers a robust platform for building intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative AI agents**. The framework can integrate agents from multiple sources, including Foundry Agent Service, and supports both multi-agent collaboration and human-agent interaction. Agents can work together to orchestrate sophisticated workflows, where each agent specializes in a specific task, such as data collection, analysis, or decision-making. The framework also facilitates human-in-the-loop processes, enabling agents to augment human decision-making by providing insights or automating repetitive tasks. This combination of autonomy, collaboration, and interactivity makes the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework an ideal choice for applications requiring dynamic, goal-oriented behavior.

## Create an agent group chat

A key feature of the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework is its ability to facilitate interactions between multiple agents. Using `AgentGroupChat`, developers can **create dynamic, multi-agent conversations where different types of agents collaborate to generate responses**.

The `AgentGroupChat` class extends the AgentChat framework, providing a structured way to manage multi-agent collaboration. It offers built-in mechanisms to control conversation flow, define collaboration strategies, and support both single-turn and multi-turn interactions.

To create the `AgentGroupChat`, you can initialize the chat object with a predefined set of agents. For example:

`# Define agents`
`agent_writer = AzureAIAgent(...)
agent_reviewer = AzureAIAgent(...)`

`# Create chat with participating agents`
`chat = AgentGroupChat(agents=[agent_writer, agent_reviewer])`

Or you can start with an empty chat and add agents dynamically. For example:

### Add messages to the chat

Once your chat is created, you can create a `ChatMessageContent` object and add it to the chat thread. The `ChatMessageContent` object takes a role parameter in addition to the content. For example:

`chat_message = ChatMessageContent(role=AuthorRole.USER, content="This is the message content.")`
`await chat.add_chat_message(message=chat_message)`

### Conversation Modes in AgentGroupChat

Agent group chats can operate in two distinct modes, depending on the conversation requirements:

In **single-turn conversations**, a designated agent provides a response based on user input.

- You can invoke a response from a single-turn chat by using `AgentGroupChat.invoke` and specifying the agent that should respond. For example:

In **multi-turn conversations**, multiple agents take turns responding, continuing the conversation until a termination condition is met.

- Agent responses are returned asynchronously as they are generated, allowing the conversation to unfold in real-time.

- You can invoke a response from a multi-turn chat by using `AgentGroupChat.invoke`. For example:

## [Design an agent selection strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/orchestrate-semantic-kernel-multi-agent-solution/4-design-agent-selection-strategy)

**One key feature of the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework is its support for intelligent, multi-agent interactions**. Agent collaboration can be achieved using `AgentGroupChat`, which has some critical components to consider that aren't necessary with single agents or non-agentic Semantic Kernel applications.

The following units discuss an example multi-agent solution, where we have two agents in a writer-reviewer scenario:

- A copywriter agent who writes online content, called `CopywriterAgent`.
- A creative director only reviewing the proposals, called `ReviewingDirectorAgent`.

### Agent selection

It's important to choose the agent that's best suited to respond to a user's query, especially in multi-agent systems where the agents specialize in different domains.

For example, if you chat with the agents asking for a slogan for a new scrubbing brush, the `ReviewingDirectorAgent` shouldn't be invoked to respond since they don't know how to write slogans. Instead, having the `CopywriterAgent` respond would provide the user with an accurate response.

### Why is agent selection important?

- **Accuracy**: Routing queries to the most relevant agent ensures precise responses.
- **Efficiency**: It reduces processing time by using the expertise of specialized agents.
- **Scalability**: Proper selection allows the framework to handle diverse queries without overwhelming individual agents, and provides the best response to the user as the number of agents in the chat grows.

### How does the framework select agents?

Single-turn conversations

- **Intent recognition**: The framework analyzes the user's query to identify the intent and match it with the most relevant agent.
- **Predefined rules**: Developers can configure routing rules to direct specific queries to designated agents in their application.

Multi-turn conversations

- **Context tracking**: The framework maintains a record of the conversation history to understand the user's intent and select the appropriate agent.
- **Dynamic switching**: If the topic shifts, the framework dynamically switches to an agent specializing in the new domain in the middle of the conversation.

#### Agent selection strategy

For multi-turn agents, agent selection is determined by a selection strategy. **The selection strategy is defined within the framework, either by using a predefined selection strategy or by extending a SelectionStrategy class to define custom selection behavior**. You can define the selection strategy when you create the `AgentGroupChat` object.

**SequentialSelectionStrategy**

- The `SequentialSelectionStrategy` class offers a predefined selection strategy where the agent turn order is based on the order in which the agents were added to the chat. The option to specify an initial agent is also available.

**KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy**

- The `KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy` class allows you to define your selection strategy by creating a kernel function from a prompt. In our writer and reviewer example, your selection strategy prompt might be as follows. If your preferred interaction should always have a certain agent respond first, that can be specified in your selection strategy as seen in the prompt above.

**SelectionStrategy** base class

- The `SelectionStrategy` base class contains an overridable `select_agent` method where you can define custom logic for selecting the next agent. The return value must be an agent that is present in the group chat.

Once you decide on your selection strategy, you can assign it to the `selection_strategy` parameter of the `AgentGroupChat` object.

### Truncating chat history

Since the selection strategy will typically **rely on the last message in the chat to determine the next agent**, you can truncate the chat history to reduce token usage and help improve performance. The `KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy` accepts a `history_reducer` parameter which you can specify as:

`history_reducer = ChatHistoryTruncationReducer(target_count=1)`

---

## Define a chat termination strategy

Multi-turn conversations have responses returned asynchronously, so the conversation can develop naturally. However, the agents need to know when to stop a conversation, which is determined by the termination strategy.

### Termination strategy

A termination strategy ensures that conversations or tasks conclude appropriately. This strategy prevents unnecessary messages to the user, limits resource usage, and improves the overall user experience.

For example, in the writer-reviewer agent scenario, once the `ReviewingDirectorAgent` reviews and approves our scrubbing brush slogan from the `CopywriterAgent`, us humans know the conversation should be over. However, if we don't define when to terminate the conversation, the `CopywriterAgent` is going to keep submitting slogans unnecessarily.

#### Why use a termination strategy?

- **Efficiency**: It prevents endless loops or prolonged interactions, saving computational resources.
- **User satisfaction**: Users receive concise and relevant responses, avoiding frustration from overly long conversations.
- **Goal completion**: The use of an agent is to complete a task. By terminating appropriately. It confirms when a task or conversation has achieved its intended purpose.

#### How does the framework implement termination strategies?

Similar to how the selection strategy is specified, developers can define a termination strategy or use a predefined strategy. Each termination strategy supports a `maximum_iterations` parameter that will end the chat after a maximum number of iterations. The default value is *99 iterations*. Each termination strategy also requires the agents which should run the strategy. In the writer-reviewer agent scenario, the `ReviewingDirectorAgent` should determine when the chat should terminate.

**DefaultTerminationStrategy**

- The `DefaultTerminationStrategy` class will only terminate after the **specified number of maximum iterations**.

**KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy**

- The `KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy` class allows you to define your termination strategy by creating a kernel function from a prompt. In our writer and reviewer example, your selection strategy prompt might be:

- This class requires a `result_parser` parameter. The `result_parser` is a function that processes the output of your prompt function **to determine whether the termination condition has been met**. It takes the output of the prompt function and processes it to return `True` or `False`.

**TerminationStrategy base class**

- The `TerminationStrategy` base class contains an overridable `should_agent_terminate` method where you can define custom logic for concluding the agent group chat. **The return value must be a Boolean**. For example, you could define a termination function that checks the most recent history entry for just the word "yes", however, you would need to provide explicit instructions to your agent to return the **termination keyword**.

Once you've decided on your termination strategy, you can assign it to the `termination_strategy` parameter of the `AgentGroupChat` object.

#### Truncating chat history

Since the termination strategy will **typically rely on the last message in the chat to determine whether the chat should terminate**, you can truncate the chat history to reduce token usage and help improve performance. The `KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy` accepts a `history_reducer` parameter which you can specify as:

`history_reducer = ChatHistoryTruncationReducer(target_count=1)`

#### Conversation state

Whether you use `AgentGroupChat` for a *single-turn* or *multi-turn* conversation, the state updates to completed once it meets the termination criteria. However, you may want to use the group chat instance again. To keep using the same chat instance, you'll need to reset the completion state to `False`. Without a state reset, the `AgentGroupChat` can't accept new interactions.

**When a conversation hits the maximum number of iterations allowed, the conversation will end but won't be marked as completed**. In this case, you can extend the conversation without resetting the conversation state.

By understanding these components, you can better utilize the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework to build intelligent multi-agent systems.

## [Exercise - Develop a multi-agent solution](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-agents/Instructions/05-agent-orchestration.html)

Now it's your opportunity to b**uild a multi agent solution with the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework**. In this exercise, you create an application that automatically triages and resolves issues presented in log files of a system. Using Azure AI Agents, you create an *incident manager agent* and a *devops agent* that collaborates to fix the issues.

### Develop a multi-agent solution

In this exercise, you’ll **create a project that orchestrates two AI agents using the Semantic Kernel SDK**. 
- An **Incident Manager agent** will analyze service log files for issues. If an issue is found, the Incident Manager will recommend a resolution action, and 
- A **DevOps Assistant agent** will receive the recommendation and invoke the corrective function and perform the resolution. The Incident Manager agent will then review the updated logs to make sure the resolution was successful.

For this exercise, four sample log files are provided. The DevOps Assistant agent code only updates the sample log files with some example log messages.
