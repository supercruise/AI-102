# [Detect, analyze, and recognize faces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/)

The ability for applications to **detect human faces, analyze facial features and emotions, and identify individuals** is a key artificial intelligence capability.

## Learning objectives
After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the capabilities of the Azure AI Vision Face service.
- Write code to detect and **analyze faces** in an image.
- Describe facial recognition support in Azure AI Vision Face.
- Describe **responsible AI** considerations when developing facial solutions.

## Introduction

**Face detection, analysis, and recognition** are all common computer vision challenges for AI systems. The ability to detect when a person is present, analyze a person's facial features, or recognize an individual based on their face is a key way in which AI systems can exhibit human-like behavior and build empathy with users.

In this module, you'll explore how the **Azure AI Vision Face API** enables you to build solutions that analyze faces in images.

> Note: Access to the full capabilities of the Face API is restricted in accordance with Microsoft's responsible AI policies. For details, see [Limited Access to Face API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/limited-access-identity). This module describes some capabilities that require explicit access. The practical exercise in the module is based on unrestricted features of the service.

## Plan a face detection, analysis, or recognition solution

The **Face** service provides comprehensive **facial detection, analysis, and recognitio**n capabilities.

![capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/face-service.png)

### Face Features

The Face service provides functionality that you can use for:

1. **Face detection** - for each detected face, the results include an ID that identifies the face and the bounding box coordinates indicating its location in the image.
2. **Face attribute analysis** - you can return a wide range of facial attributes, including:
    - Head pose (pitch, roll, and yaw orientation in 3D space)
    - Glasses (No glasses, Reading glasses, Sunglasses, or Swimming Goggles)
    - Mask (the presence of a face mask)
    - Blur (low, medium, or high)
    - Exposure (under exposure, good exposure, or over exposure)
    - Noise (visual noise in the image)
    - Occlusion (objects obscuring the face)
    - Accessories (glasses, headwear, mask)
    - QualityForRecognition (low, medium, or high)
3. **Facial landmark location (spatial points)** - coordinates for key landmarks in relation to facial features (for example, eye corners, pupils, tip of nose, and so on)
4. **Face comparison** - you can compare faces across multiple images for similarity (to find individuals with similar facial features) and verification (to determine that a face in one image is the same person as a face in another image)
5. **Facial recognition** - you can train a model with a collection of faces belonging to specific individuals, and use the model to identify those people in new images.
6. **Facial liveness** - liveness can be used to determine if the input video is a real stream or a fake to prevent bad-intentioned individuals from spoofing a facial recognition system.

### Face detection and recognition models

The Azure AI Vision Face API is built on face detection and recognition models that have been pre-trained. Multiple versions of these models are available, each with specific strengths and capabilities. For example, newer models exhibit greater accuracy when working with small images; but may not provide the same breadth of facial analysis capabilities. When you use the service in an application, you must select the model you want to use based on your requirements.

> Tip: For guidance about selecting a detection model, see [Specify a face detection model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/specify-detection-model). For guidance about how to select a recognition model, see [Specify a face recognition model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/specify-recognition-model).

## Detect and analyze faces

To use the **Azure AI Vision Face API**, you must provision a resource for the service in an Azure subscription. You can provision Face as a single-service resource, or you can use the Face API in a multi-service Azure AI Services resource; which can be provisioned as a standalone resource or as part of an Azure AI Foundry hub.

To use your resource from a client application you must connect to its **endpoint** using either **key-based authentication** or **Microsoft Entra AI authentication**. When using the REST interface you can provide the authentication key or token in the request header. When using a language-specific SDK (for example, the Python azure-ai-vision-face package or the Microsoft .NET **Azure.AI.Vision.Face** package), you use a **FaceClient** object to connect to the service.

`from azure.ai.vision.face import FaceClient`
`from azure.ai.vision.face.models import *`
`from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential`

`face_client = FaceClient(
    endpoint="<YOUR_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT>",
    credential=AzureKeyCredential("<YOUR_RESOURCE_KEY>"))`

To detect and analyze faces in an image, you must specify the model-specific features you want the service to return, and then use the client to call the **Detect** method.

The response from the service depends on:

- The model-specific features requested.
- The number of faces detected in the image.

A response for an image containing a single face might look similar to the following example:

## Verify and identify faces

In addition to detecting and analyzing faces, you can use the **Azure AI Vision Face service** to *compare and recognize* faces.

> Important: Usage of facial recognition, comparison, and verification requires approval through a Limited Access policy.

### Verifying faces

When a face is detected by the Face service, a unique ID is assigned to it and retained in the service resource for 24 hours. The ID is a GUID, with no indication of the individual's identity other than their facial features.

While the detected face ID is cached, subsequent images can be used to compare the new faces to the cached identity and determine if they're *similar* (in other words, they share similar facial features) or to *verify* that the same person appears in two images.

![Image](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/face-matching.png)

This ability to compare faces anonymously can be useful in systems where it's important to **confirm that the same person is present on two occasions**, without the need to know the actual identity of the person. For example, by taking images of people as they enter and leave a secured space to verify that everyone who entered leaves.

### Identifying faces

For scenarios where you need to positively identify individuals, you can train a facial recognition model using face images.

To train a facial recognition model with the Face service:

1. Create a **Person Group** that defines the set of individuals you want to identify (for example, employees).
2. Add a **Person** to the **Person Group** for each individual you want to identify.
3. Add detected faces from multiple images to each **person**, preferably in various poses. The IDs of these faces will no longer expire after 24 hours (so they're now referred to as *persisted* faces).
4. Train the model.

![faces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/person-groups.png)

The trained model is stored in your Face (or Azure AI Services) resource, and can be used by client applications to:

1. *Identify* individuals in images.
2. *Verify* the identity of a detected face.
3. Analyze new images to find faces that are *similar* to a known, persisted face.

> Tip: To learn more about using face verification and identification to implement a facial recognition solution, see [Face recognition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/concept-face-recognition) in the Azure AI Vision Face documentation.

## Responsible AI considerations for face-based solutions

While all applications of artificial intelligence require considerations for responsible, system that rely on facial or other biometric data can be particularly problematic.

When building a solution that uses facial data, considerations include (but aren't limited to):

- **Data privacy and security**. Facial data is personally identifiable, and should be considered sensitive and private. You should ensure that you have implemented adequate protection for facial data used for model training and inferencing.
- **Transparency**. Ensure that users are informed about how their facial data is used, and who will have access to it.
- **Fairness and inclusiveness**. Ensure that your face-based system can't be used in a manner that is prejudicial to individuals based on their appearance, or to unfairly target individuals.

> Note: You can find details of the responsible AI measures taken in the implementation of the Face API in [Data and privacy for Face](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/face/data-privacy-security).
