# [Classify images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/classify-images/)

Image classification is used to **determine the main subject of an image**. You can use the Azure **AI Custom Vision services** to train a model that classifies images based on your own categorizations.

## Learning objectives
After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Provision Azure resources for **Azure AI Custom Vision**
- Train an image classification model
- Use the Azure AI Custom Vision SDK to create an image classification client application

## Introduction

Image classification is a common computer vision problem that requires software to **analyze an image and categorize (or classify) it**.

For example, an unattended checkout system in a grocery store might use a camera to scan each item a customer adds to their cart, and use image classification to identify the product in the image.

In this module, you'll learn how the Azure AI Custom Vision service enables you to build your own computer vision models for image classification.

## Azure AI Custom Vision

The Azure AI Custom Vision service enables you to build your own computer vision models for **image classification or object detection**.

To use the Custom Vision service to create a solution, you need *two Custom Vision resources* in your Azure subscription:

- An **Azure AI Custom Vision training** resource - used to train a custom model based on your own training images.
- An **Azure AI Custom Vision prediction** resource - used to generate predictions from new images based on your trained model.

When you provision the Azure AI Custom Vision service in an Azure subscription, you can choose to create one or both of these resources. This separation of training and prediction provides flexibility. For example, you can use a training resource in one region to train your model using your own image data; and then deploy one or more prediction resources in other regions to support computer vision applications that need to use your model.

*Each resource has its own unique endpoint and authentication keys*; which are used by client applications to connect and authenticate to the service.

### The Custom Vision portal

Azure AI Custom Vision provides a web-based portal, in which you can train, publish, and test custom vision models.

![portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/classify-images/media/custom-vision-portal.png)

You can sign into the Custom Vision portal at https://www.customvision.ai/ using your Azure credentials and use it to create image classification or object detection projects that use Azure AI Custom Vision resources in your Azure subscription.

Each project has a unique project ID; which is used by client applications to perform training or prediction tasks using code.

### Custom Vision SDKs

You can write code to train and consume custom models by using the Azure AI Custom Vision language-specific SDKs.

For example, Microsoft C# developers can use the [Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.CustomVision.Training](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.CustomVision.Training) and [Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.CustomVision.Prediction](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.CustomVision.Prediction) Microsoft .NET packages for training and prediction respectively.

Python developers can perform both training and prediction tasks by using the [azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision) package.

## Train an image classification model

*Image classification* is a computer vision technique in which a model is trained to predict a class label for an image based on its contents. Usually, the class label relates to the main subject of the image.

For example, the following images have been classified based on the type of fruit they contain.

![fruits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/classify-images/media/classified-fruit.png)

Models can be trained for **multiclass classification** (in other words, there are multiple classes, but each image can belong to only one class) or **multilabel classification** (in other words, an image might be associated with multiple labels).

### Training an image classification model

To train an image classification model with the **Azure AI Custom Vision** service, you can use the Azure AI Custom Vision portal, the Azure AI Custom Vision REST API or SDK, or a combination of both approaches.

In most cases, you'll typically use the Azure AI Custom Vision portal to train your model.

![Azure AI Custom Vision Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/classify-images/media/train-classifier.png)

The portal provides a graphical interface that you can use to:

1. Create an image classification project for your model and associate it with a training resource.
2. Upload images, assigning class label tags to them.
3. Review and edit tagged images.
4. Train and evaluate a classification model.
5. Test a trained model.
6. Publish a trained model to a prediction resource.

The REST API and SDKs enable you to perform the same tasks by writing code, which is useful if you need to automate model training and publishing as part of a DevOps process.

## Create an image classification client application

After you've trained an image classification model, you can use the Azure AI Custom Vision SDK to develop a client application that submits new images to be classified.

## [Exercise - Classify images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/classify-images/5-exercise-custom-vision)

Now it's your turn to try using the Azure AI Custom Vision service.

In this exercise, you train and publish a custom image classification model, and use the Azure AI Custom Vision SDK to test it.

## [Classify images](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-vision/Instructions/Labs/04-image-classification.html)

The **Azure AI Custom Vision** service enables you to create computer vision models that are trained on your own images. You can use it to train image classification and object detection models; which you can then publish and consume from applications.

In this exercise, you will use the *Custom Vision* service to train an image classification model that can identify three classes of fruit (apple, banana, and orange).

In the code file, update the configuration values it contains to reflect the **Endpoint** and an **authentication Key** for your Custom Vision training resource, and the **Project ID** for the custom vision project you created previously.

`PredictionEndpoint=YOUR_PREDICTION_ENDPOINT`
`PredictionKey=YOUR_PREDICTION_KEY`
`ProjectID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
`ModelName=fruit-classifier`
